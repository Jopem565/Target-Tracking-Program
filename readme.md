**Brief Description:**

The Target Tracking application consists of a disjoint frontend and backend. The backend is written in Python and utilizes one shell script. The frontend uses NextJS as a framework. Together, they drive the Target Tracking application which allows ByteRatio employees to view their target information, plan vacations and see their impact on reaching goals, and request target changes.

Both the frontend and backend have their own readme files. The backend has two readmes: one in tt-backend and one in tt-backend/DockerFiles. The first is the main backend logic description while the second explains how to create Docker images for the automated Lambda function. The frontend has one readme which can be found in tt-frontend.
